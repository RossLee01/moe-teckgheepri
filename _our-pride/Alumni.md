**Cassidy Tan (Class of 2015)**<br>
I am Cassidy Tan, an alumni of TGPS, from the class of 2015. After graduating from TGPS, I got into National Junior College (NJC) IP stream. Currently, I am a JC1 student studying in NJC.  Read all about my invaluable experiences @ TGPS of my growing up years.

**My TGPS Chapter**<br>
My primary school life was never boring. I had lots of fun in school and always went home in high spirits. My teachers always tried their best to engage the class and make learning enjoyable for us. I could still remember vividly how the math teachers used magnets to teach us fractions and how, during science lessons, we would go down to the Eco-garden to look at the different plants we had there. Those of us brave enough even tried eating the edible plants, like the butterfly pea flower.

**Being a prefect**<br>
As a school prefect, I carried out duties during recess. Usually, my duty was to prevent students from going to the upper levels during recess by standing guard at the stairs. In case I might get bored, my friends would always look for me to chat with me while I was on duty. Thinking back, I really miss those fun, innocent days.

**Highlights in TGPS**<br>
For me, there were a lot of highlights throughout my 6 years in TGPS, from the celebrations we had (e.g teachers performing “Let it go” for Children’s Day celebrations), to the competitions (e.g SYF). These memories are ones that I really treasure as they have made my childhood a much brighter and exciting one. If I had to choose, some of the most memorable highlights for me would be the various projects I had with my friends and also, taking part in the Little Professor competition. For the projects, though I could not remember much of it, the experience of going around the Ang Mo Kio neighbouhoods taking videos and photos, and playing and exploring different playgrounds with my group of friends in the project, left a great impression.

**Beautiful memories**<br>
All these experiences and memories have shown me the importance of enjoying the process of learning. The beautiful memories made during the process are eventually what I will remember and treasure. Without the hard work of the teachers in TGPS, I would never have been able to have as much experiences and therefore, beautiful memories from my primary school days.

**Character Building @ TGPS**<br>
Team Spirit, Graciousness, Perseverance and Self-discipline - throughout my 6 years in TGPS, these 4 values have been repeated over and over to the students.They are inculcated in all Teck Ghee pupils since they first enter the school as Primary One students. Even after graduating from Primary School, these are still the values that I abide by unwaveringly. They have helped me through my toughest times, pushed me to develop myself as a leader and motivated me to do better than what I believe I can. These 4 values have stuck with me throughout my growing up years, and will continue to stay with me in the future.

**The end of my TGPS journey**<br>
I could still remember how at the end of my P6 journey, the teachers and parent volunteers worked hard to put together a graduation party for us to have fun with our friends and create new lasting memories as a cohort for the last time. We had performances, buffets and different booths set up in the hall. Everyone, including the teachers, treasured the gathering one last time before we all went our separate ways. That was one of the best days in my primary school years. I remember feeling a mix of emotions -- from excitement at finally completing the first mini hurdle in my life, to reluctance at having to leave the school where I had spent 6 years of my childhood in.

**The beginning of a new chapter**<br>
Thanks to the wonderful job done by the teachers in TGPS, providing me with various platforms and opportunities to develop and show my potential, I continued performing well in my secondary school. I joined the student council and took part in projects and competitions from various fields. Although not all have outstanding results, I really enjoyed myself every single time and made the most out of each experience, just like what I did in primary school. The teachers in TGPS have left a huge impact in my life, always showering me with support and encouragement even when I have already graduated since, and for that, I am always grateful to them. Till now, I still return to TGPS every Teachers’ Day with my old friends to visit the teachers that have taught me and watched me grow in the 6 years I was there.

**Thank you, TGPS!**<br>
