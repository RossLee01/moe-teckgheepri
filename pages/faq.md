Some important points to note:
Parents may begin their registration two years in advance of the Primary 1 Registration Exercise. Closing date for registration will be 30th April, one year before the year of the Registration exercise. However, it is important to note that there is no guarantee of a school place even if a parent volunteer performs the required hours of volunteer work.
