**\*\*Enhanced Safe Management Matters during Covid 19 Situation:** We will be limiting the number of visitors coming into the school. Should you need to come to school to meet any staff, we would prefer that an appointment to be made with our staff beforehand. We would not encourage parents/care-givers to enter the school to pass items that your children have forgotten to bring. We want to reassure you that, it is alright because our teachers and staff will be around in school to help our students manage themselves and use the opportunity to learn about personal responsibility. Exception will only be made if the items are related to health or safety concerns (e.g. medication).
