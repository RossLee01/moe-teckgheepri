### **Principal's Message**

#### **Learn . Dream . Inspire**
<img src="/images/principal1.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

As futurist and philosopher Alvin Toffler once wrote: "**_The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn._**"

Indeed, while we cannot accurately ‘predict’ the future, what we are well-positioned to do today is to prepare our children to acquire the right values, attitudes and dispositions to **_learn for life and throughout life_**.  It is through learning that they can make sense of the connected but complex world where they have to navigate around emerging trends and learn to how to self-organise to anticipate and respond to problems.

In TGPS, we take pride in **Nurturing Tomorrow’s Leaders, Today**! We do this by:
\- _Cultivating the Joy of Learning_ through [Deep Learning](https://staging.d3od0h9ii8slt3.amplifyapp.com/our-experiences/deep-learning/)<br>
\- _Building Resilience & Strengthening Relationships_ through [Positive Education](https://staging.d3od0h9ii8slt3.amplifyapp.com/our-experiences/positive-education/)<br>
\- _Achieving Well-Balanced Development_ through [Active and Healthy Living](https://staging.d3od0h9ii8slt3.amplifyapp.com/our-experiences/active-and-healthy-living/cca/sports/)<br>
\- _Making Learning Come Alive_ through [Distinctive Programmes](https://staging.d3od0h9ii8slt3.amplifyapp.com/our-experiences/distinctive-programmes/)<br>
\- _Developing Servant Leaders_ through [Student Leadership](https://staging.d3od0h9ii8slt3.amplifyapp.com/our-experiences/student-leadership/vie/)

Through our various holistic programmes and activities that are thoughtfully curated by our team of dedicated teachers and staff, we are confident that all our students will, by the end of their six-year journey with us, become **TGStars** \- students who will be well-positioned to serve and lead in whichever capacity that they so wish to in future when they have the opportunity to contribute to our society both locally and globally.  

2022 will be a milestone year for us as we will be celebrating our **20th Anniversary (TG20)**. The theme for TG20 is “**Learn, Dream and Inspire**”.

<img src="/images/principal3.jpg" style="width:65%">

Through the year-long anniversary celebration, we will draw our strength, confidence and gratitude from what we have achieved over the past 20 years, and we strive to continue to **Learn** and grow as a school.

We want our TGStars to have the courage to **Dream** and self-belief to achieve greatness in their lives. That they can also **Inspire** people around them to shine, and to aspire and achieve their dreams.

All these will be possible, when we unite as a TG Family, to learn and grow together!

With Gratitude,<br>
**Mr. Wong Jia Wang**<br>
**Principal**
