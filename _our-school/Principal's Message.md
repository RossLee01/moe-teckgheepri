### **Principal's Message**

#### **Learn . Dream . Inspire**

As futurist and philosopher Alvin Toffler once wrote: "**_The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn._**"

Indeed, while we cannot accurately ‘predict’ the future, what we are well-positioned to do today is to prepare our children to acquire the right values, attitudes and dispositions to **_learn for life and throughout life_**.  It is through learning that they can make sense of the connected but complex world where they have to navigate around emerging trends and learn to how to self-organise to anticipate and respond to problems.

In TGPS, we take pride in **Nurturing Tomorrow’s Leaders, Today**! We do this by:
