### **Music**
#### **Music in TGPS**
In TGPS, we strive to **develop character** and build capability and capacity of every student holistically. A tiered approach is adopted to teach Music, building on fundamentals and musical skills. We provide opportunities for **collaborative learning** among students through participation in ensemble performances in both instrumental and vocal settings. 

Through designing **student-centric** activities, we hope to equip students with skills to understand musical elements and concepts. Students are given the music exposure by learning a variety of instruments and learn to **appreciate the Arts** through various platforms.
