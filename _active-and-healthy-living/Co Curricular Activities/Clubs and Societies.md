The Environmental Science Club is a CCA that teaches pupils to be environmentally friendly through reducing, reusing and recycling. Pupils can learn about the various biodiversity around them and what they can do to conserve them. ICT and Multimedia is integrated in the activities when pupils are expected to do projects based on environmental issues.

The club also provides opportunities for the pupils to experience first-hand the process of exploring, investigating and discovering new knowledge in Science. Furthermore, pupils also create products using recycled materials through upcycling projects.

Pupils also get to complete Young Scientists cards to address the issues like climate change, and water and energy conservation.

Students can experience and witness the cycle of converting food waste into usable compost which helps to fertilise the soil in our garden to educate pupils about sustainability education. Students can make posters about environmental events like World Water Day and Earth Day and present in front of their peers or school mates, during the CCA or the school assembly programme.
