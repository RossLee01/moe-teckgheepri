As part of students’ safety and well-being for the upcoming Nov/Dec holidays, we seek parents’ assistance in reminding your child/ward to stay away from crime, drug/inhalant abuse and dangers of online scams.

Attachments are Joint Advisory by the Singapore Police Force (SPF), Central Narcotics Bureau of Singapore (CNB), National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) & National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) and Advisory by Health Sciences Authority (HSA) & Health Promotion board (HPB).

Thank you and Stay safe!

##### Instructions for Students Issued with Quarantine Order (QO) Intending to Sit for the PSLE.
Dear Parents/Guardians,<br>
Candidates under QO would be given special consideration (SC) for their affected National Examination papers. However, those who still wish to sit for the PSLE are given an option to apply for leave from quarantine to do so.

**Immediate action when placed on QO**<br>
Inform your child’s school immediately if your child has been placed on QO or is pending MOH's issuance of a QO. In particular, please contact your child’s school by 28 Sep 12 noon if you wish for your child to be able to take the PSLE starting 30 Sep. If your child is issued a QO after 28 Sep 12 noon, please understand that your child may only be able to take the papers for subsequent days of the PSLE.

**Testing requirements**<br>
Stay home and wait for the PCR test to be administered. In the meantime, conduct daily ART for your child every evening.

**Upon confirmation of the negative PCR test result**<br>
Inform the school when your child has received confirmation of the negative PCR test result. Your school will inform you when your child is approved to sit for their examination papers. Take the ART after 6pm, the day before each paper.

**Turn-around time for PCR result**<br>
As swabs may require more than a 24-hour turn-around period, your child will not be able to take the examination paper within the next 48 hours. Your child can apply for SC.

**On the day of the examination**<br>
Your child has to do a daily ART and present a photo of the ART indicator to the school. If you wish to leave your home and drop off your child at school, you will also need a negative PCR test. Travel directly to the school by private transport or on foot, with no stops in between.

If your child is not able to take any of the papers, the school will assist you with the SC application. You may find out more about SC from [https://go.gov.sg/s-c](https://go.gov.sg/s-c)

For a summary of the procedure, please see attached and refer to the SEAB website. If you need any clarification regarding the QO leave application, please reach out to your child’s school.

##### P6 Calendar of Events - reference for Vaccination Appointments
Dear Parents/Guardians,<br>
All eligible P6 students aged 12 and above before 8 June 2021 will be invited for vaccination from 4 June 2021

You may receive the SMS invites from 4 June onwards to schedule your child’s vaccination appointments through the National Appointment System to secure a desired timeslot and location.  To facilitate the scheduling of the vaccination, you may take reference of the P6 level calendar of events listed below.

**Dates to avoid**

|  |  |
|---|---|
| 29 & 30 July | School-based Preliminary Oral Exams |
| 12 & 13 August | PSLE Oral - English and Mother Tongue |
| 16 to 26 August | School-based Preliminary LC & Written Exams |
| 17 September | PSLE Listening Comprehension Exam |
| 30 September to 6 October | PSLE Written Exams |
|

May we suggest that you ensure that there is a gap of at least 5-7 days from the dates listed above so that your child may have the time and space to recuperate from the effects of the vaccination, if any.

While the COVID-19 vaccination is not mandatory, we would strongly encourage all medically eligible students to be vaccinated when the vaccine is made available to them and to register for a vaccination slot early.

Do consult your child’s/ward’s doctor if your child/ward has underlying medical conditions that might affect their medical eligibility. 

Thank you.

##### 2021 Term 1 Parents' Letter
Dear Parent/Guardian,<br>
MOH has advised Singapore residents to defer all travel overseas, with the exception of travel to an evolving list of countries, where COVID-19 is under control and the risk of importation is low. To ensure schools continue to be a healthy and safe environment for all, we require parents/guardians to make a travel declaration only if your child/ward intends to travel for the year-end holidays. NIL returns are not required. To make your travel declaration via Parents' Gateway, go to \[SERVICE > DECLARE TRAVELS\]. Please declare your child/ward’s travel plans, indicating both the country and city of travel, and any city of transit, by 30 Oct (Friday). Only one parent is required to declare. In planning your travel, please refer to the attached advisory on travelling. If there is a change of travel plans after declaration, please inform the school directly rather than through Parents’ Gateway.  
A hard-copy form was issued to students whose parents are not onboard Parents' Gateway.  
Thank you for your partnership and support to keep our school safe.

##### From Us to You: Stay Home, Stay Safe, Stay Curious!
Dear Parent/Guardian, <br>
Unlike previous mid-year holidays, your children will be spending their holiday at home. In case you're wondering how you can occupy them, we've pulled together some activities that you can do as a family while staying home during the May holidays. Take this chance to strengthen bonds, have fun and keep on learning! We have uploaded an SLS lesson package (titled: "From Us to You: Stay Home, Stay Safe, Stay Curious!") that is specially curated by our TGPS teachers to encourage your children to be meaningfully engaged during the mid-year school holidays. Do log in to the SLs and try out some of the fun and interesting activities with your children. We are very sure that you will enjoy it too. In addition, we have also attached the Parent Kit (School Holiday Edition) that is prepared by MOE, for more ideas on what your family could do together during the holidays. Take care and we'll see you soon.
