##### **Joint Advisory by SPF, CNB, NCPC and NCADA and Advisory by HSA and HPB for 2022 Nov/Dec Holidays**

Dear Parents/Guardians,

As part of students’ safety and well-being for the upcoming Nov/Dec holidays, we seek parents’ assistance in reminding your child/ward to stay away from crime, drug/inhalant abuse and dangers of online scams.

Attachments are Joint Advisory by the Singapore Police Force (SPF), Central Narcotics Bureau of Singapore (CNB), National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) & National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) and Advisory by Health Sciences Authority (HSA) & Health Promotion board (HPB).

Students have also seen a Discipline & Safety Advisories video to remind them of the dangers and how to protect themselves from becoming victims of crime.

Thank you and Stay safe!

Yours sincerely,<br>
Jet Tan<br>
Vice Principal (Admin)

##### Instructions for Students Issued with Quarantine Order (QO) Intending to Sit for the PSLE.
Dear Parents/Guardians,

Candidates under QO would be given special consideration (SC) for their affected National Examination papers. However, those who still wish to sit for the PSLE are given an option to apply for leave from quarantine to do so.

**Immediate action when placed on QO**<br>
Inform your child’s school immediately if your child has been placed on QO or is pending MOH's issuance of a QO. In particular, please contact your child’s school by 28 Sep 12 noon if you wish for your child to be able to take the PSLE starting 30 Sep. If your child is issued a QO after 28 Sep 12 noon, please understand that your child may only be able to take the papers for subsequent days of the PSLE.

**Testing requirements**<br>
Stay home and wait for the PCR test to be administered. In the meantime, conduct daily ART for your child every evening.

**Upon confirmation of the negative PCR test result**<br>
Inform the school when your child has received confirmation of the negative PCR test result. Your school will inform you when your child is approved to sit for their examination papers. Take the ART after 6pm, the day before each paper.

**Turn-around time for PCR result**<br>
As swabs may require more than a 24-hour turn-around period, your child will not be able to take the examination paper within the next 48 hours. Your child can apply for SC.

**On the day of the examination**<br>
Your child has to do a daily ART and present a photo of the ART indicator to the school. If you wish to leave your home and drop off your child at school, you will also need a negative PCR test. Travel directly to the school by private transport or on foot, with no stops in between.

If your child is not able to take any of the papers, the school will assist you with the SC application. You may find out more about SC from [https://go.gov.sg/s-c](https://go.gov.sg/s-c)

For a summary of the procedure, please see attached and refer to the SEAB website. If you need any clarification regarding the QO leave application, please reach out to your child’s school.
