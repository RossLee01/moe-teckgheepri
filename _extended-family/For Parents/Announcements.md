##### **Joint Advisory by SPF, CNB, NCPC and NCADA and Advisory by HSA and HPB for 2022 Nov/Dec Holidays**

Dear Parents/Guardians,

As part of students’ safety and well-being for the upcoming Nov/Dec holidays, we seek parents’ assistance in reminding your child/ward to stay away from crime, drug/inhalant abuse and dangers of online scams.

Attachments are Joint Advisory by the Singapore Police Force (SPF), Central Narcotics Bureau of Singapore (CNB), National Crime Prevention Council (NCPC) & National Council Against Drug Abuse (NCADA) and Advisory by Health Sciences Authority (HSA) & Health Promotion board (HPB).

Students have also seen a Discipline & Safety Advisories video to remind them of the dangers and how to protect themselves from becoming victims of crime.

Thank you and Stay safe!

Yours sincerely,<br>
Jet Tan<br>
Vice Principal (Admin)
